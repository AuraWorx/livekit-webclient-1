# User Integration with LiveKit - PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Google Auth user integration with LiveKit participant identification. Currently, all participants are assigned random identities like `voice_assistant_user_8751`, making it difficult to identify authenticated users in voice sessions. This feature will integrate authenticated Google users with their actual user information for better session management and user experience.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- All participants get random identities: `voice_assistant_user_XXXX`
- No way to identify which authenticated user is in a session
- Difficult to track user sessions and provide personalized experiences
- Guest users and authenticated users are indistinguishable in LiveKit sessions

### Desired State
- Authenticated users have identifiable participant identities (email, name, or user ID)
- Guest users continue to use random identities for privacy
- Session tracking and user management capabilities
- Consistent participant identity across sessions for authenticated users

## Goals

- Integrate Google Auth user information with LiveKit participant identification
- Maintain security and privacy for both authenticated and guest users
- Provide consistent user experience across sessions
- Enable session tracking and user management features
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

## User Stories

### As an Authenticated User
- I want my participant identity to reflect my actual name or email
- I want consistent identification across different voice sessions
- I want my sessions to be trackable and manageable

### As a Guest User
- I want to maintain privacy with random participant identities
- I want to continue using the app without authentication
- I want my sessions to remain anonymous

### As a System Administrator
- I want to track which users are participating in sessions
- I want to manage user sessions and access
- I want to provide personalized experiences based on user identity

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements

#### Authentication Integration
- Pass authenticated user information to LiveKit connection process
- Handle both authenticated and guest user scenarios
- Maintain user context throughout the session lifecycle

#### API Integration
- Modify connection details API to accept user information
- Generate appropriate participant identities based on user type
- Maintain security for room names and access tokens

#### User Experience
- Consistent participant identification across sessions
- Clear distinction between authenticated and guest users
- Seamless integration with existing authentication flow

### Backend Requirements

#### API Modifications
- Update `/api/connection-details` endpoint to accept user context
- Generate participant identities based on user authentication status
- Maintain security standards for room and token generation

#### Security Considerations
- Secure handling of user information
- Proper token validation and expiration
- Protection against identity spoofing

## Implementation Approach

### Option 1: Modified API Endpoint (Recommended)

#### Overview
Modify the existing `/api/connection-details` endpoint to accept user information and generate appropriate participant identities based on authentication status.

#### Implementation Details

**1. Frontend Changes**
- Update `useConnectionDetails` hook to pass user information
- Include user context in API requests
- Handle both authenticated and guest scenarios

**2. Backend Changes**
- Modify `/api/connection-details` to accept user data
- Generate participant identity based on user type:
  - **Authenticated users:** Use `user.email` or `user.id`
  - **Guest users:** Use random generation (current approach)
- Maintain random room name generation for security

**3. Participant Identity Strategy**
```typescript
// Authenticated users
const participantIdentity = user ? user.email : `voice_assistant_user_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;

// Room names remain random for security
const roomName = `voice_assistant_room_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;
```

### Option 2: Frontend Token Generation

#### Overview
Generate participant tokens on the frontend using user information and validate with backend.

#### Pros
- More control over participant identity generation
- Reduced backend complexity

#### Cons
- Security concerns with client-side token generation
- Requires additional backend validation

### Option 3: Session-Based Approach

#### Overview
Store user session information and generate participant identity based on session data.

#### Pros
- Consistent identity across sessions
- Easy session management

#### Cons
- Additional session management complexity
- Potential session persistence issues

## Technical Architecture

### Modified API Flow

```
Frontend (useConnectionDetails)
    ↓ (with user context)
/api/connection-details
    ↓ (generate based on user type)
LiveKit Token Generation
    ↓
Room Connection
```

### User Context Integration

```typescript
// Updated useConnectionDetails hook
const { user, isAuthenticated, isGuest } = useAuth();

const fetchConnectionDetails = useCallback(() => {
  const url = new URL('/api/connection-details', window.location.origin);
  
  // Add user context to request
  const requestOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      user: isAuthenticated ? {
        id: user?.id,
        email: user?.email,
        firstName: user?.firstName,
        lastName: user?.lastName
      } : null,
      isGuest
    })
  };
  
  fetch(url.toString(), requestOptions)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setConnectionDetails(data));
}, [user, isAuthenticated, isGuest]);
```

### API Endpoint Modifications

```typescript
// Updated /api/connection-details/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { user, isGuest } = await request.json();
  
  // Generate participant identity based on user type
  const participantIdentity = user 
    ? user.email || `user_${user.id}`
    : `voice_assistant_user_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;
  
  const participantName = user 
    ? `${user.firstName || ''} ${user.lastName || ''}`.trim() || user.email
    : 'Guest User';
  
  // Room names remain random for security
  const roomName = `voice_assistant_room_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;
  
  const participantToken = await createParticipantToken(
    { identity: participantIdentity, name: participantName },
    roomName
  );
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    serverUrl: LIVEKIT_URL,
    roomName,
    participantToken,
    participantName,
    participantIdentity
  });
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- User information transmitted securely via HTTPS
- No sensitive data stored in client-side storage
- Proper token validation and expiration

### Identity Security
- Authenticated users can only use their own identity
- Guest users maintain anonymous random identities
- Room names remain random to prevent guessing attacks

### Session Security
- Token expiration (15 minutes) prevents long-term access
- Proper cleanup on session end
- No persistent session data stored insecurely

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- Handle cases where user information is unavailable
- Fallback to guest mode for authentication failures
- Clear error messages for users

### API Errors
- Graceful degradation when connection details API fails
- Retry mechanisms for temporary failures
- User-friendly error messages

### Network Issues
- Handle connection timeouts
- Provide offline mode capabilities
- Clear feedback for connectivity issues

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
